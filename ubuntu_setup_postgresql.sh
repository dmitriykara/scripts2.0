sudo apt update

#Then, install the Postgres package along with a -contrib package that adds some additional utilities and functionality:
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

#Ensure that the service is started:
sudo systemctl start postgresql.service

# Do not forget to grant permissions
# ALTER DATABASE <db_name> OWNER TO <user_name>;
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO <user_name>;
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO <user_name>;
# GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public to <user_name>;
